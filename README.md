# Java Preparation Exercise

A hands-on journey to learn Java through 11 real-world command-line projects‚Äîeach crafted to sharpen your OOP, logic, and problem-solving skills from the ground up.

---

## Our Motivation

We struggled with Java basics in college, and we wanted to create a practical learning experience that would help students of all levels improve their Java skills. We found that college assignments were not quite enough. Many of us have been struggling to find a proper project to get started with. We were taught to code but never quite on how to implement it. We wanted to create a project that would help students understand the concepts better. So we created this repo of projects to help students learn Java in a fun-interactive way.

## üí° Why build this?

Java is a powerful, industry-grade language, but learning it through theory alone can be limiting. This repo helps you:

- üöÄ Level up by solving real-world problems.
- üß† Understand OOP concepts, collections, exceptions, and file handling.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Started

To get started, we will need some software;

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Download the latest version from the official Oracle website. [Download Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Choose your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code with Java plugins).
    - **Eclipse**: Download from the official Eclipse website. [Download Here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
    - **IntelliJ IDEA**: Download from the JetBrains website. [Download Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
    - **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install the Java extension. [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com)

---

## üß™ Requirement

- Java 8+ (recommended: Java 17+)
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming, variables, data types, and control structures.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a folder name Java_Exercise in your desired location

```bash
mkdir Java_Exercise
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the folder

```bash
cd Java_Exercise
```

### Step 3: Make the folder for the project you want to build

```bash
mkdir <Project_name>
```

Replace `<Project_name>` with the name of the project you want to build. For example, if you want to build the Student Grade Calculator, you would replace `<Project_name>` with `Student_Grade`.

## üöÄ How to Run Each Project

Each project is contained within its respective folder and comes with a detailed README on how to run and test it.

To build and run a project:

```bash
# compile (replace <Folder_name> with the project folder)
cd <Folder_name>
javac *.java

# run (replace MainClass with the CLI entry class)
java MainClass.java
```

## Disclaimer

Even though our aim is to make sure that you understand the concepts, we don't expect you to copy paste the code. We expect you to try to understand the project requirements and then write the code for it yourself. If you feel stuck or confused about the solution we have provided hints and pseudocode and ultimately the solution as well in the respective project directory. <br> <br>
<b>This repo is for learning purpose, we don't guarantee that it will help you master java but we ensure that it will help you understand programming.</b>
