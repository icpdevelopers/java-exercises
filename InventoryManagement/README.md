# Inventory Management

Welcome, budding Java developer! ðŸ‘‹ In this miniâ€“project you will build a **command-line inventory management** consisting of two files: `InventoryItem.java` and `InventoryManagerCLI.java`. By the end, you will have a tiny inventory management app you can run from any terminal â€“ just like the software that powers real inventory management systems.

# Why build this?

Building a simple inventory management system is a great way to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. You will also get a chance to practice working with classes, objects, and methods.
