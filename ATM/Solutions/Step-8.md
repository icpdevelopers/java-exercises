# Step 8 - Run and test the program

Now that we have finished making a simple ATM we can now run the program and test it.

To run the program, We can then compile and run the program.

```bash
javac ATM.java
java ATM
```

We can then test the program by withdrawing and depositing money.

To withdraw money, we can enter the choice 1 and then enter the amount to withdraw.

To deposit money, we can enter the choice 2 and then enter the amount to deposit.

To display the balance, we can enter the choice 3.

To exit the program, we can enter the choice 4.

We can also test the program by withdrawing more money than the current balance. In this case, the program will display the message "Insufficient funds."

We can also test the program by depositing a negative amount. In this case, the program will display the message "Invalid amount."

We can also test the program by withdrawing a zero amount. In this case, the program will display the message "Invalid amount."

We can also test the program by depositing a zero amount. In this case, the program will display the message "Invalid amount."
