# Step 1 - ATMAccount Class

First we need to make a class name `ATMAccount`

```java
public class ATMAccount{

}
```

And after we have made the class we can add private attributes to it.

```java
public class ATMAccount{
    private int accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    private int pinNumber;
}
```
